“After Constantine had turned the Eagle
counter to heaven’s course, the course it took
behind the ancient one who wed Lavinia,

one hundred and one hundred years and more,
the bird of God remained near Europe’s borders,
close to the peaks from which it first emerged;

beneath the shadow of the sacred wings,
it ruled the world, from hand to hand, until
that governing—changing—became my task.

Caesar I was and am Justinian,
who, through the will of Primal Love I feel,
removed the vain and needless from the laws.

Before I grew attentive to this labor,
I held that but one nature—and no more—
was Christ’s—and in that faith, I was content;

but then the blessed Agapetus, he
who was chief shepherd, with his words turned me
to that faith which has truth and purity.

I did believe him, and now clearly see
his faith, as you with contradictories
can see that one is true and one is false.

As soon as my steps shared the Church’s path,
God, of His grace, inspired my high task
as pleased Him. I was fully drawn to that.

Entrusting to my Belisarius
my arms, I found a sign for me to rest
from war: Heaven’s right hand so favored him.

My answer to the question you first asked
ends here, and yet the nature of this answer
leads me to add a sequel, so that you

may see with how much reason they attack
the sacred standard—those who seem to act
on its behalf and those opposing it.

See what great virtue made that Eagle worthy
of reverence, beginning from that hour
when Pallas died that it might gain a kingdom.

You know that for three hundred years and more,
it lived in Alba, until, at the end,
three still fought three, contending for that standard.

You know how, under seven kings, it conquered
its neighbors—in the era reaching from
wronged Sabine women to Lucrece’s grief—

and what it did when carried by courageous
Romans, who hurried to encounter Brennus,
Pyrrhus, and other principates and cities.

Through this, Torquatus, Quinctius (who is named
for his disheveled hair), the Decii,
and Fabii gained the fame I gladly honor.

That standard brought the pride of Arabs low
when they had followed Hannibal across
those Alpine rocks from which, Po, you descend.

Beneath that standard, Scipio, Pompey—
though young—triumphed; and to that hill beneath
which you were born, that standard seemed most harsh.

Then, near the time when Heaven wished to bring
all of the world to Heaven’s way—serene—
Caesar, as Rome had willed, took up that standard.

And what it did from Var to Rhine was seen
by the Isere, Saone, and Seine and all
the valley—floors whose rivers feed the Rhone.

And what it did, once it had left Ravenna
and leaped the Rubicon, was such a flight
as neither tongue nor writing can describe.

That standard led the legions on to Spain,
then toward Durazzo, and it struck Pharsalia
so hard that the warm Nile could feel that hurt.

It saw again its source, Antandros and
Simois, and the place where Hector lies;
then roused itself—the worse for Ptolemy.

From Egypt, lightning—like, it fell on Juba;
and then it hurried to the west of you,
where it could hear the trumpet of Pompey.

Because of what that standard did, with him
who bore it next, Brutus and Cassius howl
in Hell, and grief seized Modena, Perugia.

Because of it, sad Cleopatra weeps
still; as she fled that standard, from the asp
she drew a sudden and atrocious death.

And, with that very bearer, it then reached
the Red Sea shore: with him, that emblem brought
the world such peace that Janus’ shrine was shut.

But what the standard that has made me speak
had done before or then was yet to do
throughout the mortal realm where it holds rule,

comes to seem faint and insignificant
if one, with clear sight and pure sentiment,
sees what it did in the third Caesar’s hand;

for the true Justice that inspires me
granted to it—in that next Caesar’s hand-
the glory of avenging His own wrath.

Now marvel here at what I show to you:
with Titus—afterward—it hurried toward
avenging vengeance for the ancient sin.

And when the Lombard tooth bit Holy Church,
then Charlemagne, under the Eagle’s wings,
through victories he gained, brought help to her.

Now you can judge those I condemned above,
and judge how such men have offended, have
become the origin of all your evils.

For some oppose the universal emblem
with yellow lilies; others claim that emblem
for party: it is hard to see who is worse.

Let Ghibellines pursue their undertakings
beneath another sign, for those who sever
this sign and justice are bad followers.

And let not this new Charles strike at it with
his Guelphs—but let him fear the claws that stripped
a more courageous lion of its hide.

The sons have often wept for a father’s fault;
and let this son not think that God will change
the emblem of His force for Charles’s lilies.

This little planet is adorned with spirits
whose acts were righteous, but who acted for
the honor and the fame that they would gain:

and when desires tend toward earthly ends,
then, so deflected, rays of the true love
mount toward the life above with lesser force.

But part of our delight is measuring
rewards against our merit, and we see
that our rewards are neither less nor more.

Thus does the Living Justice make so sweet
the sentiments in us, that we are free
of any turning toward iniquity.

Differing voices join to sound sweet music;
so do the different orders in our life
render sweet harmony among these spheres.

And in this very pearl there also shines
the light of Romeo, of one whose acts,
though great and noble, met ungratefulness.

And yet those Provencals who schemed against him
had little chance to laugh, for he who finds
harm to himself in others’ righteous acts

takes the wrong path. Of Raymond Berenger’s
four daughters, each became a queen—and this,
poor and a stranger, Romeo accomplished.

Then Berenger was moved by vicious tongues
to ask this just man for accounting—one
who, given ten, gave Raymond five and seven.

And Romeo, the poor, the old, departed;
and were the world to know the heart he had
while begging, crust by crust, for his life—bread,

it—though it praise him now—would praise him more.”
